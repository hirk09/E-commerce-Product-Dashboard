# E-commerce-Product-Dashboard
Build a single-page web application for a fictional e-commerce dashboard. The application should display a list of products, allow for filtering and sorting, and support loading more products dynamically as the user scrolls. The focus should be on code structure, design patterns, dynamic data loading, responsiveness, and optimization.
